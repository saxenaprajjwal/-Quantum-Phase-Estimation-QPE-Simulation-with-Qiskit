# Quantum_Phase_Estimation_QPE_Simulation_with_Qiskit
This project implements and explores the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm using Qiskit and Aer simulators. QPE is a foundational algorithm in quantum computing used to estimate the phase (eigenvalue) associated with an eigenvector of a unitary operator, and plays a central role in algorithms such as Shorâ€™s algorithm and HHL.  


The project includes:

A QPE circuit with inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT).

Simulation of QPE for different phase values.

Analysis of QPE performance across different shot counts and ancilla register sizes.

Visualization of measurement outcomes and scaling behavior of estimation error.
