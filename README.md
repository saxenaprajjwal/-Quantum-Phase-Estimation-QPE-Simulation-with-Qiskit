# -Quantum-Phase-Estimation-QPE-Simulation-with-Qiskit
This project implements and explores the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm using Qiskit and Aer simulators. QPE is a foundational algorithm in quantum computing used to estimate the phase (eigenvalue) associated with an eigenvector of a unitary operator, and plays a central role in algorithms such as Shorâ€™s algorithm and HHL.
